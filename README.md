# 🎬 IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Explainability Tools

End-to-End NLP Pipeline with EDA, ML & LSTM Models for Business Insights

----

## 📄 Project Overview

    This project performs end-to-end Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews and classifies them into Positive or Negative sentiments.

    It combines classical ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), deep learning models (LSTM, BERT Fine-Tuning), and Explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME)..

    The goal is to identify customer satisfaction vs dissatisfaction, helping platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime drive content recommendations, retention strategies, and marketing decisions.

---

## 📊 Business Problem

    Understanding customer feedback at scale is crucial for entertainment platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc., to:

    Improve content recommendations.

    Detect dissatisfaction early.

    Enhance customer retention and satisfaction.

    Accurately classifying sentiment from millions of reviews supports data-driven business decisions.

## 📚 Dataset

Source: IMDb 50K Review Dataset - Kaggle.                         

Records: 50,000 reviews (balanced: 25K Positive, 25K Negative).                                 

*Features:*

    review: Text of the review

    sentiment: Positive or Negative

## 🏗️ Phases Completed

***Phase***	     ***Description***	              ***Key Techniques***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	    Exploratory Data Analysis	   -  Review Length, Sentiment Distribution

2.	    Text Preprocessing	           -  Cleaning, Removing Stopwords, Lemmatization

3.	    Machine Learning Baselines	   -  TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, Random Forest

4.	    Deep Learning	               -  LSTM Neural Network

5.	    Transformer Fine-Tuning        -  BERT Model Fine-tuning

6.	    Explainability	               -  SHAP, LIME for model interpretation

## 🎯 Results Summary

***Model***	         -***Accuracy***-	 ***Business Impact***

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logistic Regression	 -   89.8%	    -  Fast & lightweight model for basic deployment

Random Forest	     -   85.9%	    -  More complex but lower performance

LSTM	             -   53.4%	    -  High overfitting, not optimal

BERT Fine-Tuned	     -   93.1%	    -  Highest accuracy, ready for real-world deployment

✅ Logistic Regression served as a fast benchmark.

✅ BERT fine-tuning dramatically improved sentiment detection.

---

## 🧠 Explainability Summary
 
SHAP - Identified top positive/negative influential words.

LIME - Provided local explanations for individual reviews.

✅ Explainability builds stakeholder trust.

---

## 📈 Business Impact
        
    - Potential uplift of ~3–5% customer retention by detecting dissatisfaction early.

    - Estimated revenue protection up to $5M–$7M annually for companies like Netflix (based on average churn rates and membership costs).
