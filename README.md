üé¨ IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Explainability Tools

End-to-End NLP Pipeline with EDA, ML & LSTM Models for Business Insights


üìÑ **Project Overview:**

    This project performs end-to-end Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews and classifies them into Positive or Negative sentiments.

    It combines classical ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), deep learning models (LSTM, BERT Fine-Tuning), and Explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME)..

    The goal is to identify customer satisfaction vs dissatisfaction, helping platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime drive content recommendations, retention strategies, and marketing decisions.


üìä **Business Problem:**

    Understanding customer feedback at scale is crucial for entertainment platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc., to:

    Improve content recommendations.

    Detect dissatisfaction early.

    Enhance customer retention and satisfaction.

    Accurately classifying sentiment from millions of reviews supports data-driven business decisions.


üìö**Dataset:**

Source: IMDb 50K Review Dataset - Kaggle.                         

Records: 50,000 reviews (balanced: 25K Positive, 25K Negative).                                 

*Features:*

    review: Text of the review

    sentiment: Positive or Negative


üèóÔ∏è**Phases Completed:**

Phase	     Description	              Key Techniques
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	    Exploratory Data Analysis	     Review Length, Sentiment Distribution

2	    Text Preprocessing	             Cleaning, Removing Stopwords, Lemmatization

3	    Machine Learning Baselines	     TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, Random Forest

4	    Deep Learning	                 LSTM Neural Network

5	    Transformer Fine-Tuning          BERT Model Fine-tuning

6	    Explainability	                 SHAP, LIME for model interpretation


üéØ **Results Summary:**

Model	               Accuracy	      Business Impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logistic Regression	    89.8%	     Fast & lightweight model for basic deployment

Random Forest	        85.9%	     More complex but lower performance

LSTM	                53.4%	     High overfitting, not optimal

BERT Fine-Tuned	        93.1%	     Highest accuracy, ready for real-world deployment

‚úÖ Logistic Regression served as a fast benchmark.

‚úÖ BERT fine-tuning dramatically improved sentiment detection.


üß† **Explainability Summary:**

Tool	What It Did
----    --------------------------------------------------  
SHAP	Identified top positive/negative influential words.

LIME	Provided local explanations for individual reviews.

‚úÖ Explainability builds stakeholder trust.


üìà **Business Impact:**
        
    - Potential uplift of ~3‚Äì5% customer retention by detecting dissatisfaction early.

    - Estimated revenue protection up to $5M‚Äì$7M annually for companies like Netflix (based on average churn rates and membership costs).
